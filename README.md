### Hey! <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fi-made-steamhappy-vector-image-v0-jmmqmwzwk14c1.png%3Fwidth%3D800%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D7cc8498450fbd323b22899722ac24cbd23a91a83&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=cf2f957af1296b6b3a9febaaa10fe2b80cb5fe8c846f3e7fe7e2c4f5d21e4f73" width=20 height=20>
I'm Josh, a Computer Science student based in the UK 🇬🇧

I have experience developing basic forms applications in Visual Basic and C# in school, and am currently focused on my A-Level project, which involves making a game in <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-engine">Unity</a>.

> I am currently also learning <a href="https://rust-lang.org"> Rust</a> for systems engineering. I currently use WSL for development, and look fully switch from VS Code to Neovim + Tmux for development by the end of the year.

I'm also really picky about what repos I make public, as if it's not fit for public use, I don't see why it should be made public.

I spend my free time primarily playing Counter-Strike, or any indie game obsession I currently have.
